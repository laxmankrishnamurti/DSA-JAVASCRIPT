# Chapter - 05 (JavaScript Array)

- Array :: Arrays are one of the most fundamental data structures. It is also like a variable but the special thing is that it can store multiple values within a single variable. Their data-type may vary.

For any data structure, developers are interested in time and space complexity associated with the four fundamental operation: Access, Insertion, Deletion, and Search.

- Time complexity of <code>.push()</code>, <code>.pop()</code>, <code>.unshift()</code> ....etc is O(n) in theory. But it should be noted that practically, this totaly depends on the JavaScript engine that runs the code. This applies to all natively supported javascript object.
