# What is prime factorization?

I know at this point of stage this question dosen't make sense too much but just for understanding lets know about prime factorization.

Prime factorization is the process of breaking down a number into its smallest prime factors. And believe me guys this is not as much easy as you think. And this is more than of it's own defination.

ex:- 18 :: 18 / 2 = 9; 9 / 3 = 3; 3 / 3 = 1
Hence,
Prime factorization of 18 is :- 2 _ 3 _ 3. which can also represent in this form :- 2 \* 3^2

- Application

  - Cryptography (Fundamental for encryption)
  - Simplifying fractions
  - Finding LCM & GCD | HCF
  - Solving Diophantine Equations

    - Ex :- Finding solution for this equation : 12x + 15y = 1

  - Understanding number properties
  - Efficient computation
